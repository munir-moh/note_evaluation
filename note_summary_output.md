The note revolves around the concepts of interaction design focusing on usability from the user's perspective. It delves into design principles, processes, and evaluation techniques within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), highlighting the notion of design as achieving goals within constraints, often requiring trade-offs. Essential rules of design involve understanding human and computer aspects. The design process is iterative, encompassing stages like requirements, analysis, and translating needs into actionable plans. Within the software process, it discusses the software development life-cycle, stressing activities such as requirement specification, architectural design, coding, testing, integration, and maintenance. Despite depicting design in a sequential manner, the iterative nature of design is emphasized, alongside a call for considering user perspectives. The note ends with a reflective prompt comparing the general design process with the software design process for effective technology.
